    cyclictest: add command line option for unbuffered output
    
    When reading the output from cyclictest with another program, the data is
    buffered by default. This prevents nice 'live' display.
    This patch adds an command line option to force the output to always be
    unbuffered.

    When creating an RPM package with the newly provided test pip, the message
    error: Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:
       /usr/bin/pip
    appeared, and rpmbuild refused to finish building the package.

    rt-tests: Add a new test pip - priority inheritance with processes
    
    This test is similar to pi_stress in that it purpursely triggers a priority-
    inversion. However, instead of using pthreads it uses processes.
    Since pthread_mutex_t are the only objects backed by priority inheritance
    this is accomplished by having the processes use a pthread_mutex_t in
    shared memory. See the header of pip.c for more information as well as the
    code of course.
    
    In addition this patch starts a src/include directory as a common place
    to put header files.

    rt-tests: pi_stress: Remove racy state variables that cause watchdog to trigger
    
    When using pthread_barrier_wait, it is important that barriers are called
    the correct number of times. That is - the same number given as the count
    when initializing the barrier.
    
    There was a do-while loop around elevate_barrier in the med priority thread.
    On most machines, it actually never looped.
    
    On threads with enough processors (nehelam for example), there was a racy
    situation in which the high priority thread could come out of the finish
    barrier, and before it could set high_has_run = 0, the medium priority
    thread would test the value and call the elevate barrier an extra time.
    
    This patch removes the bogus loop and related state variables and fixes
    the hang.

    There was a do-while loop around elevate_barrier in the med priority thread.
    On most machines, it actually never looped.
    
    On threads with enough processors (nehelam for example), there was a racy
    situation in which the high priority thread could come out of the finish
    barrier, and before it could set high_has_run = 0, the medium priority
    thread would test the value and call the elevate barrier an extra time.
    
    This patch removes the bogus loop and related state variables and fixes
    the hang.

    Current cyclictest support FIFO policy for static priority of
    RT threads only. Append policy option to support FIFO or RR by user.
    
    After this patch.
    1) with FIFO about RT threads(default)
       ./cyclictest -t 5 -p 50
    or ./cyclictest -t 5 -p 50 -y 1
    or ./cyclictest -t 5 -p 50 --policy 1
    
    2) with RR about RT threads(default)
       ./cyclictest -t 5 -p 50 -y 2
    or ./cyclictest -t 5 -p 50 --policy 2
    
    This is screenshot of threads using cyclictest & tuna utility after patch.

    If we run a many threads with -t option, "priority--" rt priority will assign
    per thread in sequence. But, If we use -h option, all threads is same priority.
    
    Append man page and cyclictest usage about the same priority of many threads
    with -h option.
    
    ex) cyclictest -t 5 -p 50        [enter] <-- without -h
    ex) cyclictest -t 5 -p 50 -h 100 [enter] <-- with    -h

    Subject: Handle doomsday latency for cyclictest in histogram mode
    
    Don't miss latency which exceed the histogram limit -
    instead sample limit exceeding latency in the last bucket.
    
    This is a leftover from cyclictest_histogram.patch:
    -> Todo: Currently cyclictest does not report the number of samples
    -> that exceeded the histogram max latency.
    
    Handle OOM.

    Avoid segfault of cyclictest if it gets immediately interrupted.
    
    If clock_nanosleep() gets interrupted this could result in a negative
    time diff from calcdiff().
    
    With the histogram patch this leads to a segfault, since the time diff
    is used as index for the histogram array:
    
    Core was generated by `/usr/bin/cyclictest -n -q -p 99 -t 2 -i 500 -l
    1000000 -h
     20000'.

        [PATCH] cyclictest: Add tracing function about wakeup and wakeup_rt of ftrace.
    
        This is patch to support wakeup & wakeup_rt tracing at the argument of
        cyclictest additionally. Current cyclictest support three tracing
        like PREEMPTOFF, IRQSOFF, PREEMPTIRQSOFF just.
    
        This additional function will help wakeup related tracing
        about sleep api [ex: nanosleep() , usleep] of cyclictest.
    
        Practically speaking, wakeup(+wakeup-rt) tracing by steven rostedt is useful
        in the linux based embedded product development.

    cyclictest: Remove duplicated description of cyclictest usage like -h.

        [PATCH] cyclictest: Remove duplicated description of cyclictest usage like -h.
    
        We often utilize a various options with "#>cyclictest --help" command in the terminal environment.
        When We run "#> cyclictest --help" command, We can show duplicated description about "-h" option
        for latency histogram.
        Unfortunatley, Some of the users is confusing because of two options about latency histogram.
    
        [root@fedora9 invain]# ./cyclictest --help
        cyclictest V 0.36
        Usage:
        cyclictest <options>
    
        -a [NUM] --affinity        run thread #N on processor #N, if possible
                                   with NUM pin all threads to the processor NUM
        -b USEC  --breaktrace=USEC send break trace command when latency > USEC
        -B       --preemptirqs     both preempt and irqsoff tracing (used with -b)
        -c CLOCK --clock=CLOCK     select clock
                                   0 = CLOCK_MONOTONIC (default)
                                   1 = CLOCK_REALTIME
        -C       --context         context switch tracing (used with -b)
        -d DIST  --distance=DIST   distance of thread intervals in us default=500
        -E       --event           event tracing (used with -b)
        -f       --ftrace          function trace (when -b is active)
        -h H_MAX                   latency histogram size in us default 0 (off)
        -i INTV  --interval=INTV   base interval of thread in us default=1000
    
             ................. [Middle Omission] ...................
    
        -v       --verbose         output values on stdout for statistics
                                   format: n:c:v n=tasknum c=count v=value in us
        -D       --duration=t      specify a length for the test run
                                   default is in seconds, but 'm', 'h', or 'd' maybe added
                                   to modify value to minutes, hours or days
        -h       --histogram=US    dump a latency histogram to stdout after the run
                                   US is the max time to be be tracked in microseconds
    
        For example,
    
        -h H_MAX                   latency histogram size in us default 0 (off)
    
        -h       --histogram=US    dump a latency histogram to stdout after the run
                                   US is the max time to be be tracked in microseconds
    
        As you see, We don't need "-h H_MAX  . . . . . ." description.
        So, I think that We have to remove old option about description of histogram function.

        [patch] cyclictest: bugfix getopt_long() for -C and -F.
    
        We can not use -C option without --context option for tracing context switching.
        ex) ./cyclictest -t 10 -m -b 100 -C
        We can not use -E option without --event option for tracing events.
        ex) ./cyclictest -t 10 -m -b 100 -E
        Append -C and -E option on getopt_long() function to solve this problems.

    split function of DESTDIR into DESTDIR + prefix
    
    It's more common that DESTDIR doesn't include /usr or /usr/local but
    only the base directory for a relocated installation.  The in-tree
    prefix is usually named "prefix".
    
    "usually" here means as it is done by autoconf and as it is expected by
    the Debian package helpers.
    
    While at it also make the other path variables match this convention.

    reworked settracer()
    
    GeunSik Lim <leemgs1@gmail.com> found a problem with settracer()
    in that it had a hardcoded limit to the number of tracers searched.
    Unfortunately his patch found a bug in either fscanf or debugfs,
    since it doesn't seem to return EOF at the end of input, so I reworked
    the patch to read all the input and parse it using strtok.

    cyclictest: init tracer only once
    
    The tracer setup happens in every thread, which is nonsense. First of
    all it leads to a lot of irritating warnings because the things are
    setup multiple times. The worst effect is that one tasks runs already
    into the tracer stop condition and the next one reenables the tracer.
    
    Move the tracer setup into the main thread and do it only once.

    This patch has cyclictest work a bit better with ftrace. Some new options
    have been added.
    
    When -b is used:
    
      -P : use the preemptoff tracer
      -I : use the irqsoff tracer
      -B : use preemptirqsoff tracer
    
    If the above are not set, then it tries to use "events" tracer if it is
    available (currently only available in the -rt kernel) and if that is not
    set, it defaults to the sched-switch tracer.
    
    -f will enabled the function tracer.

    Fix the processing of optional options for cyclictest
    
    Problem: when running cyclic test, short options are not parsing
    optional arguments correctly when followed by a space.
    "-t3" works, but "-t 3" does not.
    
    - Fix the processing of options with optional parameters, so that the user
      can write -tNUM or -t NUM and it will work as expected. This was done
      for the -t and -a options
    
    - Modify the usage messages to correspond with the way the program makes use
      of the options.

    cyclictest: handle latest ftrace
    
    This patch has cyclictest work a bit better with ftrace. Some new options
    have been added.
    
    When -b is used:
    
      -P : use the preemptoff tracer
      -I : use the irqsoff tracer
      -B : use preemptirqsoff tracer
    
    If the above are not set, then it tries to use "events" tracer if it is
    available (currently only available in the -rt kernel) and if that is not
    set, it defaults to the sched-switch tracer.
    
    -f will enabled the function tracer.

    cyclictest: add -o option to reduce -v option's output speed
    
    When the output of the -v option is piped into another program and if
    more data are sent than the other program can eat, data points get
    lost. Since high latency values normally occur much less frequently
    than average latency values, the connected program will miss many of
    the high latency values, and the realtime capability of a given system
    may appear much better than it is.
    
    Therefore, the new option -o RED was introduced. This option causes
    cyclictest to suppress every subsequent RED number of samples and
    replace them with the maximum of the values encountered during that
    sampling interval.

    cyclictest: add CPU affinity
    
    Add CPU affinitt option to cyclictest.
    
    1. New option -a:
    
    without argument to a cyclictest spreads the threads consecutive on
    the available CPUs. On a quad core machine we get:
    
    -a -t4   Thread #0 -> CPU #0
             Thread #1 -> CPU #1
             Thread #2 -> CPU #2
             Thread #3 -> CPU #3
    
    -a -t5   Thread #0 -> CPU #0
             Thread #1 -> CPU #1
             Thread #2 -> CPU #2
             Thread #3 -> CPU #3
             Thread #4 -> CPU #0
    
    Adding a CPU number to the -a option all threads are pinned to
    the given CPU:
    
    -a3 -t4  Thread #0 -> CPU #3
             Thread #1 -> CPU #3
             Thread #2 -> CPU #3
             Thread #3 -> CPU #3
    
    2. extension of the -t option:
    
    Without argument to -t cyclictest starts as many threads as CPUs are
    available.

    Fix to cyclictest (from signaltest fix)
    
    This is a patch that's a ripple from the bug in signaltest that Luis and Jeff Burke
    were working on. Looks like there's a race where a variable can be used
    uninitialized, depending on thread scheduling circumstances. Probably not major, but
    hey, can't hurt :).

    Signaltest: initialize stat[i].threadstarted before using
    
    Signaltest was hanging in a wide variety of kernel versions, in some cases
    after a few iterations and in other cases right after being called on the
    command line. We created a bugzilla ticket for this issue:
    
    	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=308231
    
    After a few debug sessions we realized that a shared variable used to
    synchronize the work between threads, stat[i].threadstarted, could end up
    being used before initialization depending on the scheduling of the
    threads.
    
    The fix is a one-liner.
